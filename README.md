# Ungergrad-Projects
This repository contains projects that are completed during my undergraduate times (2014-2018) at Boston University.

## Classes Taken with Projects
CS111 Introduction to Computer Science I: Text Comparison
```
• Built a program to test text similarity
• Utilized Python to code and run the program that checks two distinct text and see 
the commonality of two
• Used word frequency, prefix and suffix of words, and text related features in the 
comparison
```


CS411 Software Engineering: Investment Portfolio
```
• Used JavaScript to build a web page that analyzes and compares performance of
different mutual funds, pension funds, and private equity firms
• Implemented Yahoo! Finance API to help users get great view about what the day’s
funds are incrementing and finding the fund(s) they may want to invest through the
questionnaire of the web page
```


CS460 Introduction to Database Systems: Photo Sharing System
```
• Designed a photo share system similar to Flickr that allow users to share photos 
with their friends and allows users to create albums, upload photos, write comments 
to photos, and add friends with other users
• Utilized MySQL for photo database management and maintained in Flask in Python
```


CS506 Computational Tools for Data Science: Mapping the Intensity of Energy Use Across Boston University
```
• Programmed models through Linear Regression Model, Quadratic Nonlinear
Regression Model and Logistic Regression Model to find factors that contribute most 
to Boston University’s gas usage and electricity usage among temperature, water intensity,
greenhouse gas intensity, building age and building type
• By analyzing models, found the factor that can use less and lessen either gas usage 
or electricity usage in order to achieve the goal of Carbon Neutral in the future
```


CS542 Machine Learning: Real Estate Price Trending Prediction in Boston
```
• Implemented Machine Learning techniques to create a project that by inputting longitudes 
and latitudes of a point in Boston, a predicted real estate price to the point would 
be given
• Utilized neupy and sklearn libraries in Python to machine learning neural network 
that takes in several price affecting factors of real estate market and learn to give
the output that is estimated through learning factors and their influences
```


CS591 Computational Game Theory: Parrondo's Paradox
```
• Investigated Parrondo'x Paradox in mathematical notions and read papers to find its 
relation with the computational part of Game Theory
```


CS591 Data Mechanics for Pervasive Systems and Urban Applications: Boston Crime & Housing Price Analyzation
```
• Programmed a project that retrieve data from internet and perform transformations onto 
datasets to analyze Boston’s crime reports in relation to Boston’s property assessment, 
police district distribution and labor complaints within crime areas
• Built a webpage that shows crime points and the result of optimization point which is 
the safest place to live in Boston and points of crime incidents
```


### Due to data store, projects from several classes have been missed.
