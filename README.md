# Ungergrad-Projects
This repository contains projects that are completed during my undergraduate times (2014-2018) at Boston University.

## Classes Taken with Projects
CS111 Introduction to Computer Science I: Text Comparison
```
• Built a program to test text similarity
• Utilized Python to code and run the program that checks two distinct text and see 
the commonality of two
• Used word frequency, prefix and suffix of words, and text related features in the 
comparison
```


CS411 Software Engineering: Investment Portfolio
```
•	Used JavaScript to build a web page that analyzes and compares the performance of 
different mutual funds, pension funds, and private equity firms
•	Implemented Yahoo! Finance API to help users get great view about what the day’s 
funds like and find the fund(s) they may want to invest through the questionnaire of 
the web page
```


CS460 Introduction to Database Systems: Photo Sharing System
```
•	Designed a photo share system similar to Flickr that allows users to create albums, 
upload photos, write photo comments, add friends and share photos with other users
•	Utilized MySQL for photo database management and maintained the system in Flask in 
Python

```


CS506 Computational Tools for Data Science: Mapping the Intensity of Energy Use Across Boston University
```
•	Programmed models through Linear Regression Model, Quadratic Nonlinear Regression 
Model and Logistic Regression Model to find factors that contribute most to Boston 
University’s gas usage and electricity usage among factors such as temperature, water 
intensity, greenhouse gas intensity, building age and building type
•	By analyzing models, found the factor that can use less and lessen either gas usage 
or electricity usage in order to achieve the goal of Carbon Neutral in the future

```


CS542 Machine Learning: Real Estate Price Trending Prediction in Boston
```
•	Implemented Machine Learning techniques to create a project that by inputting 
longitudes and latitudes of a point in Boston, a predicted real estate price to the 
point would be given
•	Utilized neupy and sklearn libraries in Python in machine learning neural network that
takes in several price affecting factors of real estate market and gives the output that
is estimated through learning factors and their influences

```


CS591 Computational Game Theory: Parrondo's Paradox
```
• Investigated Parrondo'x Paradox in mathematical notions and read papers to find its 
relation with the computational part of Game Theory
```


CS591 Data Mechanics for Pervasive Systems and Urban Applications: Boston Crime & Housing Price Analyzation
```
•	Programmed a project that retrieves data from the internet and performs transformations
onto datasets to analyze Boston’s crime reports in relation to Boston’s property 
assessment, police district distribution and labor complaints
•	Built a web page that shows crime points and the result of the optimization point 
which is the safest but cheapest place to live in Boston

```


### Due to data store, projects from several classes have been missed.
